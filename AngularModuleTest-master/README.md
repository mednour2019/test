# Angular DataTable Implementation
# The project is in master Branch
# Description
In this technical test project, I implemented a dynamic and responsive data table using Angular, designed to manage employee data retrieved from an external API. The project showcases advanced table functionalities, including pagination, sorting, filtering, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, all handled on the frontend.
